                    <p style = "text-indent:5%;">In this section, I will share my academic and professional expereiences in detail while also introducing some other aspects of myself 
                    such as my interests to give you a better idea of who I am as a person. <br><br></p>
                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p style = "text-indent:5%;">
                        During my undergraduate, I studied at University of Toronto St. George for 4 years to attain my Bachelor of Science majoring in Mathematics and Statistics.
                        I've always had an interest in math since highschool and it was a subject I knew I wanted to learn more about and pursue a career in the field or a career with 
                        elements of it. After taking some statistics courses, I found that I really enjoyed learning about the various models and theorems that can be used to get insightful findings 
                        from data and being able to make real world decisions from them.
                    </p>
                    <p style = "text-indent:5%;">
                        After my undergraduate, I completed a Certificate in Data Analytics. I wanted to take the course so I could have hands on practice implementing various data analysis 
                        project. It was a course I enjoyed immensely since it allowed me to reinforce my learnings in practical projects and how I could apply them in real world settings. 
                        The course also expanded my skills in languages such as Python, SQL, and R. With the addition of skills such as Javascript and HTML5 it gave me the ability
                        to use my creative side in order to design and build the websites such as the one you're currently using. I've always loved Art in highschool but didn't think it was a career I could puruse 
                        but the course has allowed me to combine both my interest in art and design with coding. It also gives me the ability to design data visualization to share my findings 
                        from my projects in easy to understand and interactive formats.<br><br>

                        interseted in Statistics and share school services and tips that will give them an easy transition into university school life. 
                        I was very interested in the role as I empathsized with the students knowing how the first year of university can be overwhelming especially if you are 
                        maneuvering through it by yourself. I

                        In my final year, I volunteered to be a data collector for the Learning Enrichment Foundation. They are an amazing organization that provides services such as skills training with 
                        programs and certifications to help with employment in their local community. With a team of 6 we conducted surveys through the phone with the foundation's 
                        client database to gather information on why a new location's foot traffic was significantly lower. The teams went over the questions, and categorize answers in 
                        order to get to have some consistency in survey answers and minimize bias.

                        After I graduated, my first position with Toys R Us was as a Merchandise Assistant. I worked closely with the merchandise buyers and 
                        the marketing team. My main responsibilites were to review weekly promotional flyers and the inventory of promotional goods in order to 
                        maxmize sales and customer satisfaction. When I was working in this role I made it a point to be as proactive as posssible, where after completing my tasks if 
                        I did not have work to ask my buyers or other buyers if they needed additional help on any projects and if there wasn't any to find work on my own whether it 
                        be in reviewing company processes or looking at current reports I could improve. Thanks to this I was able to receive many company peer recommendations that 
                        allowed me to be chosen for AGR Supply Chain Analyst.

                        In this role my main duties were to manage item forecast at a store level in order to maxmize sales. In addition, I was to allocate items to store where necessary,
                        while also reviewing inventory distribution and making any changes if needed. This role allowed me to expand on my merchandising knowledge as 
                        an assistant and examine the data in a more analytical approach using the tools and software provided in the position. During my time 
                        in this role, I noticed that the team had a problem in identifying items with inventory problem in our weekly flyers. The initial process 
                        was very manual and since there were many flyers planned in advance with the addition of orders constantly being updated and changed it 
                        was hard for analyst to review and identify all problem sku's weekly. In order to solve this, I took the intiative to create a query pulling data 
                        from their databases and wrote a VBA script to automatize this process and flag sku's that will not meet inventory demands for the flyer. The report is 
                        currently the main tool used in the department to track and flag any inventory issues for the buyers and marketing team.

                <h3>Hobbies & Interest</h3>
                <h5>Rock Climbing</h5>
                I first started rock climbing in 2019, the first time I went with a group of friends and I was instantly hooked. It was an activity I knew right away that 
                I wanted to continue doing for the rest of my life. If you don't know much about rock climbing some people's first reaction is "Why? You just climb to the top and that's it", but 
                like any sport there are many techniques and levels of difficulty that goes into climbing. With climbing it's even easier to gauge your progress in climbing as there are levels. For bouldering 
                which is climbing without a rope on shorter walls it ranges from V0-V15. Top rope entails the rope is already anchored at the top with a partner belaying you from below. Lead rope entails the 
                rope being tied to you and not anchored at the top and you bring the rope with you as you climb and clip into quickdraws. The rope climbs range from 5.2 to 5.11 where from 5.10 and above there 
                are inner grades such as 5.10a, 5.10b, 5.10c and 5.10d. I would consider myself better than a beginner but not as skilled as some of my climber friends. My current grades would be V3/V4 on boulders,
                top rope 5.11b and lead rope 5.10a on redpoint (which means when you climb without taking a fall).
                <br><br>
                I think what I love about climbing is the problem solving, it's almost like a puzzle you're trying to solve. When you're trying to top a wall you learn that are many ways to complete it, some 
                being more efficient or tiring than others. With climbing it has change my mindset that I should always keep an open mind. 
                Sometimes you may get stuck on a climb where you keep trying the same moves because you're so sure it should be climbed a particular way and you're just unable to stick the move but I've learned with climbing 
                that you have to keep an open mind. 
                It's easy to get tunnel vision when you're in the middle of a project to only focus on the move you think you need to do but sometimes it's good to take a step back and 
                look at the problem as a whole and try to think of alternative beta.
                <br><br>
                <h5>Baking</h5>
                Baking gives me an outlet to explore my creative and art side. It allows me to design and create baking projects while also being able to eat something delicious.
